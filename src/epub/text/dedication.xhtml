			<pre xml:space="preserve">DEDICATION George Washington President Of The United States Of America Sir, I present you a small treatise in defence of those principles of freedom which your exemplary virtue hath so eminently contributed to establish. That the Rights of Man may become as universal as your benevolence can wish, and that you may enjoy the happiness of seeing the New World regenerate the Old, is the prayer of Sir, Your much obliged, and Obedient humble Servant,     Thomas Paine</pre>
