			<h3 epub:type="title">Miscellaneous Chapter</h3>
			<p>To prevent interrupting the argument in the preceding part of this work, or the narrative that follows it, I reserved some observations to be thrown together in a Miscellaneous Chapter; by which variety might not be censured for confusion. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke’s book is <em>all</em> Miscellany. His intention was to make an attack on the French Revolution; but instead of proceeding with an orderly arrangement, he has stormed it with a mob of ideas tumbling over and destroying one another.</p>
			<p>But this confusion and contradiction in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke’s Book is easily accounted for.⁠—When a man in a wrong cause attempts to steer his course by anything else than some polar truth or principle, he is sure to be lost. It is beyond the compass of his capacity to keep all the parts of an argument together, and make them unite in one issue, by any other means than having this guide always in view. Neither memory nor invention will supply the want of it. The former fails him, and the latter betrays him.</p>
			<p>Notwithstanding the nonsense, for it deserves no better name, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke has asserted about hereditary rights, and hereditary succession, and that a nation has not a right to form a government of itself; it happened to fall in his way to give some account of what government is. “Government,” says he, “is a contrivance of human wisdom.”</p>
			<p>Admitting that government is a contrivance of human <em>wisdom</em>, it must necessarily follow, that hereditary succession, and hereditary rights (as they are called), can make no part of it, because it is impossible to make wisdom hereditary; and on the other hand, <em>that</em> cannot be a wise contrivance, which in its operation may commit the government of a nation to the wisdom of an idiot. The ground which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke now takes is fatal to every part of his cause. The argument changes from hereditary rights to hereditary wisdom; and the question is, Who is the wisest man? He must now show that everyone in the line of hereditary succession was a Solomon, or his title is not good to be a king. What a stroke has <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke now made! To use a sailor’s phrase, he has “swabbed the deck,” and scarcely left a name legible in the list of Kings; and he has mowed down and thinned the House of Peers, with a scythe as formidable as Death and Time.</p>
			<p>But <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke appears to have been aware of this retort; and he has taken care to guard against it, by making government to be not only a <em>contrivance</em> of human wisdom, but a <em>monopoly</em> of wisdom. He puts the nation as fools on one side, and places his government of wisdom, all wise men of Gotham, on the other side; and he then proclaims, and says that “Men have a <b>Right</b> that their <b>Wants</b> should be provided for by this wisdom.” Having thus made proclamation, he next proceeds to explain to them what their <em>wants</em> are, and also what their <em>rights</em> are. In this he has succeeded dextrously, for he makes their wants to be a <em>want</em> of wisdom; but as this is cold comfort, he then informs them, that they have a <em>right</em> (not to any of the wisdom) but to be governed by it; and in order to impress them with a solemn reverence for this monopoly-government of wisdom, and of its vast capacity for all purposes, possible or impossible, right or wrong, he proceeds with astrological mysterious importance, to tell to them its powers in these words: “The rights of men in government are their advantages; and these are often in balance between differences of good; and in compromises sometimes between <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em>, and sometimes between <em>evil</em> and <em>evil</em>. Political reason is a <em>computing principle</em>; adding⁠—subtracting⁠—multiplying⁠—and dividing, morally and not metaphysically or mathematically, true moral denominations.”</p>
			<p>As the wondering audience, whom <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke supposes himself talking to, may not understand all this learned jargon, I will undertake to be its interpreter. The meaning, then, good people, of all this, is: <em>That government is governed by no principle whatever; that it can make evil good, or good evil, just as it pleases. In short, that government is arbitrary power.</em></p>
			<p>But there are some things which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke has forgotten. <em>First</em>, he has not shown where the wisdom originally came from: and <em>secondly</em>, he has not shown by what authority it first began to act. In the manner he introduces the matter, it is either government stealing wisdom, or wisdom stealing government. It is without an origin, and its powers without authority. In short, it is usurpation.</p>
			<p>Whether it be from a sense of shame, or from a consciousness of some radical defect in a government necessary to be kept out of sight, or from both, or from any other cause, I undertake not to determine, but so it is, that a monarchical reasoner never traces government to its source, or from its source. It is one of the <em>shibboleths</em> by which he may be known. A thousand years hence, those who shall live in America or France, will look back with contemplative pride on the origin of their government, and say, <q>This was the work of our glorious ancestors!</q> But what can a monarchical talker say? What has he to exult in? Alas he has nothing. A certain something forbids him to look back to a beginning, lest some robber, or some Robin Hood, should rise from the long obscurity of time and say, <q>I am the origin.</q> Hard as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke laboured at the Regency Bill and Hereditary Succession two years ago, and much as he dived for precedents, he still had not boldness enough to bring up William of Normandy, and say, <q>There is the head of the list! there is the fountain of honour!</q> the son of a prostitute, and the plunderer of the English nation.</p>
			<p>The opinions of men with respect to government are changing fast in all countries. The Revolutions of America and France have thrown a beam of light over the world, which reaches into man. The enormous expense of governments has provoked people to think, by making them feel; and when once the veil begins to rend, it admits not of repair. Ignorance is of a peculiar nature: once dispelled, it is impossible to reestablish it. It is not originally a thing of itself, but is only the absence of knowledge; and though man may be <em>kept</em> ignorant, he cannot be <em>made</em> ignorant. The mind, in discovering truth, acts in the same manner as it acts through the eye in discovering objects; when once any object has been seen, it is impossible to put the mind back to the same condition it was in before it saw it. Those who talk of a counterrevolution in France, show how little they understand of man. There does not exist in the compass of language an arrangement of words to express so much as the means of effecting a counterrevolution. The means must be an obliteration of knowledge; and it has never yet been discovered how to make man <em>unknow</em> his knowledge, or <em>unthink</em> his thoughts.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke is labouring in vain to stop the progress of knowledge; and it comes with the worse grace from him, as there is a certain transaction known in the city which renders him suspected of being a pensioner in a fictitious name. This may account for some strange doctrine he has advanced in his book, which though he points it at the Revolution Society, is effectually directed against the whole nation.</p>
			<p>“The King of England,” says he, “holds <em>his</em> crown (for it does not belong to the nation, according to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke) in <em>contempt</em> of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a single vote for a king among them either <em>individually</em> or <em>collectively</em>; and his Majesty’s heirs each in their time and order, will come to the Crown <em>with the same contempt</em> of their choice, with which his Majesty has succeeded to that which he now wears.”</p>
			<p>As to who is King in England, or elsewhere, or whether there is any King at all, or whether the people choose a Cherokee chief, or a Hessian hussar for a King, it is not a matter that I trouble myself about⁠—be that to themselves; but with respect to the doctrine, so far as it relates to the Rights of Men and Nations, it is as abominable as anything ever uttered in the most enslaved country under heaven. Whether it sounds worse to my ear, by not being accustomed to hear such despotism, than what it does to another person, I am not so well a judge of; but of its abominable principle I am at no loss to judge.</p>
			<p>It is not the Revolution Society that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke means; it is the nation, as well in its <em>original</em> as in its <em>representative</em> character; and he has taken care to make himself understood, by saying that they have not a vote either <em>collectively</em> or <em>individually</em>. The Revolution Society is composed of citizens of all denominations, and of members of both the Houses of Parliament; and consequently, if there is not a right to a vote in any of the characters, there can be no right to any either in the nation or in its Parliament. This ought to be a caution to every country how to import foreign families to be kings. It is somewhat curious to observe, that although the people of England had been in the habit of talking about kings, it is always a Foreign House of Kings; hating Foreigners yet governed by them.⁠—It is now the House of Brunswick, one of the petty tribes of Germany.</p>
			<p>It has hitherto been the practice of the English Parliaments to regulate what was called the succession (taking it for granted that the nation then continued to accord to the form of annexing a monarchical branch of its government; for without this the Parliament could not have had authority to have sent either to Holland or to Hanover, or to impose a king upon the nation against its will). And this must be the utmost limit to which Parliament can go upon this case; but the right of the nation goes to the <em>whole</em> case, because it has the right of changing its <em>whole</em> form of government. The right of a Parliament is only a right in trust, a right by delegation, and that but from a very small part of the nation; and one of its Houses has not even this. But the right of the nation is an original right, as universal as taxation. The nation is the paymaster of everything, and everything must conform to its general will.</p>
			<p>I remember taking notice of a speech in what is called the English House of Peers, by the then Earl of Shelburne, and I think it was at the time he was Minister, which is applicable to this case. I do not directly charge my memory with every particular; but the words and the purport, as nearly as I remember, were these: “That the form of a Government was a matter wholly at the will of the nation at all times, that if it chose a monarchical form, it had a right to have it so; and if it afterwards chose to be a Republic, it had a right to be a Republic, and to say to a King, ‘We have no longer any occasion for you.’ ”</p>
			<p>When <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke says that “His Majesty’s heirs and successors, each in their time and order, will come to the crown with the <em>same contempt</em> of their choice with which His Majesty had succeeded to that he wears,” it is saying too much even to the humblest individual in the country; part of whose daily labour goes towards making up the million sterling a-year, which the country gives the person it styles a king. Government with insolence is despotism; but when contempt is added it becomes worse; and to pay for contempt is the excess of slavery. This species of government comes from Germany; and reminds me of what one of the Brunswick soldiers told me, who was taken prisoner by, the Americans in the late war: “Ah!” said he, “America is a fine free country, it is worth the people’s fighting for; I know the difference by knowing my own: in my country, if the prince says eat straw, we eat straw.” God help that country, thought I, be it England or elsewhere, whose liberties are to be protected by German principles of government, and Princes of Brunswick!</p>
			<p>As <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke sometimes speaks of England, sometimes of France, and sometimes of the world, and of government in general, it is difficult to answer his book without apparently meeting him on the same ground. Although principles of Government are general subjects, it is next to impossible, in many cases, to separate them from the idea of place and circumstance, and the more so when circumstances are put for arguments, which is frequently the case with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke.</p>
			<p>In the former part of his book, addressing himself to the people of France, he says: “No experience has taught us (meaning the English), that in any other course or method than that of a <em>hereditary crown</em>, can our liberties be regularly perpetuated and preserved sacred as our <em>hereditary right</em>.” I ask <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke, who is to take them away? <abbr>M.</abbr> de la Fayette, in speaking to France, says: “For a nation to be free, it is sufficient that she wills it.” But <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke represents England as wanting capacity to take care of itself, and that its liberties must be taken care of by a King holding it in “contempt.” If England is sunk to this, it is preparing itself to eat straw, as in Hanover, or in Brunswick. But besides the folly of the declaration, it happens that the facts are all against <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke. It was by the government <em>being hereditary</em>, that the liberties of the people were endangered. Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> and James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> are instances of this truth; yet neither of them went so far as to hold the nation in contempt.</p>
			<p>As it is sometimes of advantage to the people of one country to hear what those of other countries have to say respecting it, it is possible that the people of France may learn something from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke’s book, and that the people of England may also learn something from the answers it will occasion. When Nations fall out about freedom, a wide field of debate is opened. The argument commences with the rights of war, without its evils, and as knowledge is the object contended for, the party that sustains the defeat obtains the prize.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke talks about what he calls an hereditary crown, as if it were some production of Nature; or as if, like Time, it had a power to operate, not only independently, but in spite of man; or as if it were a thing or a subject universally consented to. Alas! it has none of those properties, but is the reverse of them all. It is a thing in imagination, the propriety of which is more than doubted, and the legality of which in a few years will be denied.</p>
			<p>But, to arrange this matter in a clearer view than what general expression can convey, it will be necessary to state the distinct heads under which (what is called) an hereditary crown, or more properly speaking, an hereditary succession to the government of a nation, can be considered; which are:</p>
			<p>First, the right of a particular family to establish itself.</p>
			<p>Secondly, the right of a nation to establish a particular family.</p>
			<p>With respect to the <em>first</em> of these heads, that of a Family establishing itself with hereditary powers on its own authority, and independent of the consent of a nation, all men will concur in calling it despotism; and it would be trespassing on their understanding to attempt to prove it.</p>
			<p>But the <em>second</em> head, that of a nation establishing a particular family with <em>hereditary powers</em>, does not present itself as despotism on the first reflection; but if men will permit a second reflection to take place, and carry that reflection forward but one remove out of their own persons to that of their offspring, they will then see that hereditary succession becomes in its consequences the same despotism to others, which they reprobated for themselves. It operates to preclude the consent of the succeeding generations; and the preclusion of consent is despotism. When the person who at any time shall be in possession of a Government, or those who stand in succession to him, shall say to a nation, I hold this power in “contempt” of you, it signifies not on what authority he pretends to say it. It is no relief, but an aggravation to a person in slavery, to reflect that he was sold by his parent; and as that which heightens the criminality of an act cannot be produced to prove the legality of it, hereditary succession cannot be established as a legal thing.</p>
			<p>In order to arrive at a more perfect decision on this head, it will be proper to consider the generation which undertakes to establish a Family with <em>hereditary powers</em>, apart and separate from the generations which are to follow; and also to consider the character in which the <em>first</em> generation acts with respect to succeeding generations.</p>
			<p>The generation which first selects a person, and puts him at the head of its Government, either with the title of King, or any other distinction, acts on its <em>own choice</em>, be it wise or foolish, as a free agent for itself. The person so set up is not hereditary, but selected and appointed; and the generation who sets him up, does not live under a hereditary government, but under a government of its own choice and establishment. Were the generation who sets him up, and the person so set up, to live forever, it never could become hereditary succession; and of consequence hereditary succession can only follow on the death of the first parties.</p>
			<p>As, therefore, hereditary succession is out of the question with respect to the <em>first</em> generation, we have now to consider the character in which <em>that</em> generation acts with respect to the commencing generation, and to all succeeding ones.</p>
			<p>It assumes a character, to which it has neither right nor title. It changes itself from a <em>Legislator</em> to a <em>Testator</em>, and effects to make its Will, which is to have operation after the demise of the makers, to bequeath the Government; and it not only attempts to bequeath, but to establish on the succeeding generation, a new and different form of Government under which itself lived. Itself, as already observed, lived not under a hereditary Government but under a Government of its own choice and establishment; and it now attempts, by virtue of a will and testament (and which it has not authority to make), to take from the commencing generation, and all future ones, the rights and free agency by which itself acted.</p>
			<p>But, exclusive of the right which any generation has to act collectively as a testator, the objects to which it applies itself in this case, are not within the compass of any law, or of any will or testament.</p>
			<p>The rights of men in society, are neither devisable or transferable, nor annihilable, but are descendable only, and it is not in the power of any generation to intercept finally, and cut off the descent. If the present generation, or any other, are disposed to be slaves, it does not lessen the right of the succeeding generation to be free. Wrongs cannot have a legal descent. When <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke attempts to maintain that the <em>English nation did at the Revolution of 1688, most solemnly renounce and abdicate their rights for themselves, and for all their posterity forever</em>, he speaks a language that merits not reply, and which can only excite contempt for his prostitute principles, or pity for his ignorance.</p>
			<p>In whatever light hereditary succession, as growing out of the will and testament of some former generation, presents itself, it is an absurdity. A cannot make a will to take from B the property of B, and give it to C; yet this is the manner in which (what is called) hereditary succession by law operates. A certain former generation made a will, to take away the rights of the commencing generation, and all future ones, and convey those rights to a third person, who afterwards comes forward, and tells them, in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke’s language, that they have <em>no rights</em>, that their rights are already bequeathed to him and that he will govern in <em>contempt</em> of them. From such principles, and such ignorance, good Lord deliver the world!</p>
			<p>But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy? Is it a thing, or is it a name, or is it a fraud? Is it a “contrivance of human wisdom,” or of human craft to obtain money from a nation under specious pretences? Is it a thing necessary to a nation? If it is, in what does that necessity consist, what service does it perform, what is its business, and what are its merits? Does the virtue consist in the metaphor, or in the man? Doth the goldsmith that makes the crown, make the virtue also? Doth it operate like Fortunatus’s wishing-cap, or Harlequin’s wooden sword? Doth it make a man a conjurer? In fine, what is it? It appears to be something going much out of fashion, falling into ridicule, and rejected in some countries, both as unnecessary and expensive. In America it is considered as an absurdity; and in France it has so far declined, that the goodness of the man, and the respect for his personal character, are the only things that preserve the appearance of its existence.</p>
			<p>If government be what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke describes it, “a contrivance of human wisdom” I might ask him, if wisdom was at such a low ebb in England, that it was become necessary to import it from Holland and from Hanover? But I will do the country the justice to say, that was not the case; and even if it was it mistook the cargo. The wisdom of every country, when properly exerted, is sufficient for all its purposes; and there could exist no more real occasion in England to have sent for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector, than there was in America to have done a similar thing. If a country does not understand its own affairs, how is a foreigner to understand them, who knows neither its laws, its manners, nor its language? If there existed a man so transcendently wise above all others, that his wisdom was necessary to instruct a nation, some reason might be offered for monarchy; but when we cast our eyes about a country, and observe how every part understands its own affairs; and when we look around the world, and see that of all men in it, the race of kings are the most insignificant in capacity, our reason cannot fail to ask us⁠—What are those men kept for?</p>
			<p>If there is anything in monarchy which we people of America do not understand, I wish <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke would be so kind as to inform us. I see in America, a government extending over a country ten times as large as England, and conducted with regularity, for a fortieth part of the expense which Government costs in England. If I ask a man in America if he wants a King, he retorts, and asks me if I take him for an idiot? How is it that this difference happens? are we more or less wise than others? I see in America the generality of people living in a style of plenty unknown in monarchical countries; and I see that the principle of its government, which is that of the <em>equal Rights of Man</em>, is making a rapid progress in the world.</p>
			<p>If monarchy is a useless thing, why is it kept up anywhere? and if a necessary thing, how can it be dispensed with? That <em>civil government</em> is necessary, all civilized nations will agree; but civil government is republican government. All that part of the government of England which begins with the office of constable, and proceeds through the department of magistrate, quarter-sessions, and general assize, including trial by jury, is republican government. Nothing of monarchy appears in any part of it, except in the name which William the Conqueror imposed upon the English, that of obliging them to call him “Their Sovereign Lord the King.”</p>
			<p>It is easy to conceive that a band of interested men, such as Placemen, Pensioners, Lords of the bedchamber, Lords of the kitchen, Lords of the necessary-house, and the Lord knows what besides, can find as many reasons for monarchy as their salaries, paid at the expense of the country, amount to; but if I ask the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, and down through all the occupations of life to the common labourer, what service monarchy is to him? he can give me no answer. If I ask him what monarchy is, he believes it is something like a sinecure.</p>
			<p>Notwithstanding the taxes of England amount to almost seventeen millions a year, said to be for the expenses of Government, it is still evident that the sense of the nation is left to govern itself, and does govern itself, by magistrates and juries, almost at its own charge, on republican principles, exclusive of the expense of taxes. The salaries of the judges are almost the only charge that is paid out of the revenue. Considering that all the internal government is executed by the people, the taxes of England ought to be the lightest of any nation in Europe; instead of which, they are the contrary. As this cannot be accounted for on the score of civil government, the subject necessarily extends itself to the monarchical part.</p>
			<p>When the people of England sent for George the First (and it would puzzle a wiser man than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke to discover for what he could be wanted, or what service he could render), they ought at least to have conditioned for the abandonment of Hanover. Besides the endless German intrigues that must follow from a German Elector being King of England, there is a natural impossibility of uniting in the same person the principles of Freedom and the principles of Despotism, or as it is usually called in England Arbitrary Power. A German Elector is in his electorate a despot; how then could it be expected that he should be attached to principles of liberty in one country, while his interest in another was to be supported by despotism? The union cannot exist; and it might easily have been foreseen that German Electors would make German Kings, or in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke’s words, would assume government with “contempt.” The English have been in the habit of considering a King of England only in the character in which he appears to them; whereas the same person, while the connection lasts, has a home-seat in another country, the interest of which is different to their own, and the principles of the governments in opposition to each other. To such a person England will appear as a town-residence, and the Electorate as the estate. The English may wish, as I believe they do, success to the principles of liberty in France, or in Germany; but a German Elector trembles for the fate of despotism in his electorate; and the Duchy of Mecklenburgh, where the present Queen’s family governs, is under the same wretched state of arbitrary power, and the people in slavish vassalage.</p>
			<p>There never was a time when it became the English to watch continental intrigues more circumspectly than at the present moment, and to distinguish the politics of the Electorate from the politics of the nation. The Revolution of France has entirely changed the ground with respect to England and France, as nations; but the German despots, with Prussia at their head, are combining against liberty; and the fondness of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt for office, and the interest which all his family connections have obtained, do not give sufficient security against this intrigue.</p>
			<p>As everything which passes in the world becomes matter for history, I will now quit this subject, and take a concise review of the state of parties and politics in England, as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke has done in France.</p>
			<p>Whether the present reign commenced with contempt, I leave to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke: certain, however, it is, that it had strongly that appearance. The animosity of the English nation, it is very well remembered, ran high; and, had the true principles of Liberty been as well understood then as they now promise to be, it is probable the nation would not have patiently submitted to so much. George the First and Second were sensible of a rival in the remains of the Stuarts; and as they could not but consider themselves as standing on their good behaviour, they had prudence to keep their German principles of government to themselves; but as the Stuart family wore away, the prudence became less necessary.</p>
			<p>The contest between rights, and what were called prerogatives, continued to heat the nation till some time after the conclusion of the American War, when all at once it fell a calm⁠—Execration exchanged itself for applause, and court popularity sprung up like a mushroom in a night.</p>
			<p>To account for this sudden transition, it is proper to observe that there are two distinct species of popularity; the one excited by merit, and the other by resentment. As the nation had formed itself into two parties, and each was extolling the merits of its parliamentary champions for and against prerogative, nothing could operate to give a more general shock than an immediate coalition of the champions themselves.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> The partisans of each being thus suddenly left in the lurch, and mutually heated with disgust at the measure, felt no other relief than uniting in a common execration against both. A higher stimulus or resentment being thus excited than what the contest on prerogatives occasioned, the nation quitted all former objects of rights and wrongs, and sought only that of gratification. The indignation at the Coalition so effectually superseded the indignation against the court as to extinguish it; and without any change of principles on the part of the court, the same people who had reprobated its despotism united with it to revenge themselves on the Coalition Parliament. The case was not, which they liked best, but which they hated most; and the least hated passed for love. The dissolution of the Coalition Parliament, as it afforded the means of gratifying the resentment of the nation, could not fail to be popular; and from hence arose the popularity of the court.</p>
			<p>Transitions of this kind exhibit a nation under the government of temper, instead of a fixed and steady principle; and having once committed itself, however rashly, it feels itself urged along to justify by continuance its first proceeding. Measures which at other times it would censure it now approves, and acts persuasion upon itself to suffocate its judgment.</p>
			<p>On the return of a new Parliament, the new Minister, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt, found himself in a secure majority; and the nation gave him credit, not out of regard to himself, but because it had resolved to do it out of resentment to another. He introduced himself to public notice by a proposed Reform of Parliament, which in its operation would have amounted to a public justification of corruption. The nation was to be at the expense of buying up the rotten boroughs, whereas it ought to punish the persons who deal in the traffic.</p>
			<p>Passing over the two bubbles of the Dutch business and the million a-year to sink the national debt, the matter which most presents itself, is the affair of the Regency. Never, in the course of my observation, was delusion more successfully acted, nor a nation more completely deceived. But, to make this appear, it will be necessary to go over the circumstances.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fox had stated in the House of Commons, that the Prince of Wales, as heir in succession, had a right in himself to assume the Government. This was opposed by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt; and, so far as the opposition was confined to the doctrine, it was just. But the principles which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt maintained on the contrary side were as bad, or worse in their extent, than those of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fox; because they went to establish an aristocracy over the nation, and over the small representation it has in the House of Commons.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a></p>
			<p>Whether the English form of Government be good or bad, is not in this case the question; but, taking it as it stands, without regard to its merits or demerits, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt was farther from the point than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fox.</p>
			<p>It is supposed to consist of three parts:⁠—while therefore the nation is disposed to continue this form, the parts have a <em>national standing</em>, independent of each other, and are not the creatures of each other. Had <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fox passed through Parliament, and said that the person alluded to claimed on the ground of the nation, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt must then have contended what he called the right of the Parliament against the right of the nation.</p>
			<p>By the appearance which the contest made, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fox took the hereditary ground, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt the Parliamentary ground; but the fact is, they both took hereditary ground, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt took the worst of the two.</p>
			<p>What is called the Parliament is made up of two Houses, one of which is more hereditary, and more beyond the control of the nation than what the Crown (as it is called) is supposed to be. It is an hereditary aristocracy, assuming and asserting indefeasible, irrevocable rights and authority, wholly independent of the nation. Where, then, was the merited popularity of exalting this hereditary power over another hereditary power less independent of the nation than what itself assumed to be, and of absorbing the rights of the nation into a House over which it has neither election nor control?</p>
			<p>The general impulse of the nation was right; but it acted without reflection. It approved the opposition made to the right set up by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fox, without perceiving that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt was supporting another indefeasible right more remote from the nation, in opposition to it.</p>
			<p>With respect to the House of Commons, it is elected but by a small part of the nation; but were the election as universal as taxation, which it ought to be, it would still be only the organ of the nation, and cannot possess inherent rights.⁠—When the National Assembly of France resolves a matter, the resolve is made in right of the nation; but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt, on all national questions, so far as they refer to the House of Commons, absorbs the rights of the nation into the organ, and makes the organ into a nation, and the nation itself into a cipher.</p>
			<p>In a few words, the question on the Regency was a question of a million a-year, which is appropriated to the executive department: and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt could not possess himself of any management of this sum, without setting up the supremacy of Parliament; and when this was accomplished, it was indifferent who should be Regent, as he must be Regent at his own cost. Among the curiosities which this contentious debate afforded, was that of making the Great Seal into a King, the affixing of which to an act was to be royal authority. If, therefore, royal authority is a Great Seal, it consequently is in itself nothing; and a good Constitution would be of infinitely more value to the nation than what the three Nominal Powers, as they now stand, are worth.</p>
			<p>The continual use of the word <em>Constitution</em> in the English Parliament shows there is none; and that the whole is merely a form of government without a Constitution, and constituting itself with what powers it pleases. If there were a Constitution, it certainly could be referred to; and the debate on any constitutional point would terminate by producing the Constitution. One member says this is Constitution, and another says that is Constitution⁠—Today it is one thing; and tomorrow something else⁠—while the maintaining of the debate proves there is none. Constitution is now the cant word of Parliament, tuning itself to the ear of the nation. Formerly it was the <em>universal supremacy of Parliament</em>⁠—the <em>omnipotence of Parliament</em>: But since the progress of liberty in France, those phrases have a despotic harshness in their note; and the English Parliament have catched the fashion from the National Assembly, but without the substance, of speaking of <em>Constitution</em>.</p>
			<p>As the present generation of the people in England did not make the Government, they are not accountable for any of its defects; but, that sooner or later, it must come into their hands to undergo a constitutional reformation, is as certain as that the same thing has happened in France. If France, with a revenue of nearly twenty-four millions sterling, with an extent of rich and fertile country above four times larger than England, with a population of twenty-four millions of inhabitants to support taxation, with upwards of ninety millions sterling of gold and silver circulating in the nation, and with a debt less than the present debt of England⁠—still found it necessary, from whatever cause, to come to a settlement of its affairs, it solves the problem of funding for both countries.</p>
			<p>It is out of the question to say how long what is called the English constitution has lasted, and to argue from thence how long it is to last; the question is, how long can the funding system last? It is a thing but of modern invention, and has not yet continued beyond the life of a man; yet in that short space it has so far accumulated, that, together with the current expenses, it requires an amount of taxes at least equal to the whole landed rental of the nation in acres to defray the annual expenditure. That a government could not have always gone on by the same system which has been followed for the last seventy years, must be evident to every man; and for the same reason it cannot always go on.</p>
			<p>The funding system is not money; neither is it, properly speaking, credit. It, in effect, creates upon paper the sum which it appears to borrow, and lays on a tax to keep the imaginary capital alive by the payment of interest and sends the annuity to market, to be sold for paper already in circulation. If any credit is given, it is to the disposition of the people to pay the tax, and not to the government, which lays it on. When this disposition expires, what is supposed to be the credit of Government expires with it. The instance of France under the former Government shows that it is impossible to compel the payment of taxes by force, when a whole nation is determined to take its stand upon that ground.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke, in his review of the finances of France, states the quantity of gold and silver in France, at about eighty-eight millions sterling. In doing this, he has, I presume, divided by the difference of exchange, instead of the standard of twenty-four livres to a pound sterling; for <abbr>M.</abbr> Neckar’s statement, from which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke’s is taken, is <em>two thousand two hundred millions of livres</em>, which is upwards of ninety-one millions and a half sterling.</p>
			<p><abbr>M.</abbr> Neckar in France, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> George Chalmers at the Office of Trade and Plantation in England, of which Lord Hawkesbury is president, published nearly about the same time (<time datetime="1786">1786</time>) an account of the quantity of money in each nation, from the returns of the Mint of each nation. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Chalmers, from the returns of the English Mint at the Tower of London, states the quantity of money in England, including Scotland and Ireland, to be twenty millions sterling.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></p>
			<p><abbr>M.</abbr> Neckar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a> says that the amount of money in France, recoined from the old coin which was called in, was two thousand five hundred millions of livres (upwards of one hundred and four millions sterling); and, after deducting for waste, and what may be in the West Indies and other possible circumstances, states the circulation quantity at home to be ninety-one millions and a half sterling; but, taking it as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke has put it, it is sixty-eight millions more than the national quantity in England.</p>
			<p>That the quantity of money in France cannot be under this sum, may at once be seen from the state of the French Revenue, without referring to the records of the French Mint for proofs. The revenue of France, prior to the Revolution, was nearly twenty-four millions sterling; and as paper had then no existence in France the whole revenue was collected upon gold and silver; and it would have been impossible to have collected such a quantity of revenue upon a less national quantity than <abbr>M.</abbr> Neckar has stated. Before the establishment of paper in England, the revenue was about a fourth part of the national amount of gold and silver, as may be known by referring to the revenue prior to King William, and the quantity of money stated to be in the nation at that time, which was nearly as much as it is now.</p>
			<p>It can be of no real service to a nation, to impose upon itself, or to permit itself to be imposed upon; but the prejudices of some, and the imposition of others, have always represented France as a nation possessing but little money⁠—whereas the quantity is not only more than four times what the quantity is in England, but is considerably greater on a proportion of numbers. To account for this deficiency on the part of England, some reference should be had to the English system of funding. It operates to multiply paper, and to substitute it in the room of money, in various shapes; and the more paper is multiplied, the more opportunities are offered to export the specie; and it admits of a possibility (by extending it to small notes) of increasing paper till there is no money left.</p>
			<p>I know this is not a pleasant subject to English readers; but the matters I am going to mention, are so important in themselves, as to require the attention of men interested in money transactions of a public nature. There is a circumstance stated by <abbr>M.</abbr> Neckar, in his treatise on the administration of the finances, which has never been attended to in England, but which forms the only basis whereon to estimate the quantity of money (gold and silver) which ought to be in every nation in Europe, to preserve a relative proportion with other nations.</p>
			<p>Lisbon and Cadiz are the two ports into which (money) gold and silver from South America are imported, and which afterwards divide and spread themselves over Europe by means of commerce, and increase the quantity of money in all parts of Europe. If, therefore, the amount of the annual importation into Europe can be known, and the relative proportion of the foreign commerce of the several nations by which it can be distributed can be ascertained, they give a rule sufficiently true, to ascertain the quantity of money which ought to be found in any nation, at any given time.</p>
			<p><abbr>M.</abbr> Neckar shows from the registers of Lisbon and Cadiz, that the importation of gold and silver into Europe, is five millions sterling annually. He has not taken it on a single year, but on an average of fifteen succeeding years, from <time datetime="1763">1763</time> to <time datetime="1777">1777</time>, both inclusive; in which time, the amount was one thousand eight hundred million livres, which is seventy-five millions sterling.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a></p>
			<p>From the commencement of the Hanover succession in <time datetime="1714">1714</time> to the time <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Chalmers published, is seventy-two years; and the quantity imported into Europe, in that time, would be three hundred and sixty millions sterling.</p>
			<p>If the foreign commerce of Great Britain be stated at a sixth part of what the whole foreign commerce of Europe amounts to (which is probably an inferior estimation to what the gentlemen at the Exchange would allow) the proportion which Britain should draw by commerce of this sum, to keep herself on a proportion with the rest of Europe, would be also a sixth part which is sixty millions sterling; and if the same allowance for waste and accident be made for England which <abbr>M.</abbr> Neckar makes for France, the quantity remaining after these deductions would be fifty-two millions; and this sum ought to have been in the nation (at the time <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Chalmers published), in addition to the sum which was in the nation at the commencement of the Hanover succession, and to have made in the whole at least sixty-six millions sterling; instead of which there were but twenty millions, which is forty-six millions below its proportionate quantity.</p>
			<p>As the quantity of gold and silver imported into Lisbon and Cadiz is more exactly ascertained than that of any commodity imported into England, and as the quantity of money coined at the Tower of London is still more positively known, the leading facts do not admit of controversy. Either, therefore, the commerce of England is unproductive of profit, or the gold and silver which it brings in leak continually away by unseen means at the average rate of about three-quarters of a million a year, which, in the course of seventy-two years, accounts for the deficiency; and its absence is supplied by paper.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a></p>
			<p>The Revolution of France is attended with many novel circumstances, not only in the political sphere, but in the circle of money transactions. Among others, it shows that a government may be in a state of insolvency and a nation rich. So far as the fact is confined to the late Government of France, it was insolvent; because the nation would no longer support its extravagance, and therefore it could no longer support itself⁠—but with respect to the nation all the means existed. A government may be said to be insolvent every time it applies to the nation to discharge its arrears. The insolvency of the late Government of France and the present of England differed in no other respect than as the dispositions of the people differ. The people of France refused their aid to the old Government; and the people of England submit to taxation without inquiry. What is called the Crown in England has been insolvent several times; the last of which, publicly known, was in <time datetime="1777-05">May, 1777</time>, when it applied to the nation to discharge upwards of £600,000 private debts, which otherwise it could not pay.</p>
			<p>It was the error of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke, and all those who were unacquainted with the affairs of France to confound the French nation with the French Government. The French nation, in effect, endeavoured to render the late Government insolvent for the purpose of taking government into its own hands: and it reserved its means for the support of the new Government. In a country of such vast extent and population as France the natural means cannot be wanting, and the political means appear the instant the nation is disposed to permit them. When <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke, in a speech last winter in the British Parliament, “cast his eyes over the map of Europe, and saw a chasm that once was France,” he talked like a dreamer of dreams. The same natural France existed as before, and all the natural means existed with it. The only chasm was that the extinction of despotism had left, and which was to be filled up with the Constitution more formidable in resources than the power which had expired.</p>
			<p>Although the French nation rendered the late Government insolvent, it did not permit the insolvency to act towards the creditors; and the creditors, considering the nation as the real paymaster, and the Government only as the agent, rested themselves on the nation, in preference to the Government. This appears greatly to disturb <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke, as the precedent is fatal to the policy by which governments have supposed themselves secure. They have contracted debts, with a view of attaching what is called the monied interest of a nation to their support; but the example in France shows that the permanent security of the creditor is in the nation, and not in the Government; and that in all possible revolutions that may happen in Governments, the means are always with the nation, and the nation always in existence. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke argues that the creditors ought to have abided the fate of the Government which they trusted; but the National Assembly considered them as the creditors of the nation, and not of the Government⁠—of the master, and not of the steward.</p>
			<p>Notwithstanding the late government could not discharge the current expenses, the present government has paid off a great part of the capital. This has been accomplished by two means; the one by lessening the expenses of government, and the other by the sale of the monastic and ecclesiastical landed estates. The devotees and penitent debauchees, extortioners and misers of former days, to ensure themselves a better world than that they were about to leave, had bequeathed immense property in trust to the priesthood for <em>pious uses</em>; and the priesthood kept it for themselves. The National Assembly has ordered it to be sold for the good of the whole nation, and the priesthood to be decently provided for.</p>
			<p>In consequence of the revolution, the annual interest of the debt of France will be reduced at least six millions sterling, by paying off upwards of one hundred millions of the capital; which, with lessening the former expenses of government at least three millions, will place France in a situation worthy the imitation of Europe.</p>
			<p>Upon a whole review of the subject, how vast is the contrast! While <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke has been talking of a general bankruptcy in France, the National Assembly has been paying off the capital of its debt; and while taxes have increased near a million a year in England, they have lowered several millions a year in France. Not a word has either <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke or <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pitt said about the French affairs, or the state of the French finances, in the present Session of Parliament. The subject begins to be too well understood, and imposition serves no longer.</p>
			<p>There is a general enigma running through the whole of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke’s book. He writes in a rage against the National Assembly; but what is he enraged about? If his assertions were as true as they are groundless, and that France by her Revolution, had annihilated her power, and become what he calls a chasm, it might excite the grief of a Frenchman (considering himself as a national man), and provoke his rage against the National Assembly; but why should it excite the rage of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke? Alas! it is not the nation of France that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burke means, but the court; and every court in Europe, dreading the same fate, is in mourning. He writes neither in the character of a Frenchman nor an Englishman, but in the fawning character of that creature known in all countries, and a friend to none⁠—a courtier. Whether it be the Court of Versailles, or the Court of <abbr>St.</abbr> James, or Carlton-House, or the court in expectation, signifies not; for the caterpillar principle of all courts and courtiers are alike. They form a common policy throughout Europe, detached and separate from the interest of nations: and while they appear to quarrel, they agree to plunder. Nothing can be more terrible to a court or courtier than the Revolution of France. That which is a blessing to nations is bitterness to them: and as their existence depends on the duplicity of a country, they tremble at the approach of principles, and dread the precedent that threatens their overthrow.</p>
